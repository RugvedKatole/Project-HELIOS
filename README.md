# Project-HELIOS
Project HELIOS(High Endurance
Low-Altitude Integrated Observatory System). A major strike in renewable energy is held by
solar power. In areas with sufficient solar irradiation, solar farms provide clean energy to
thousands of households. Challenge is in maintaining these solar farms. Accumulation of dust,
crack chips or delamination can negatively impact the efficiency of the solar panels. These farms
are huge in size, and inspection is time-consuming and prone to errors and human fatigue. The
project HELIOS uses fixed-wing UAVs to inspect the solar panels. High altitude images are used
to create a radiometric thermal map of the entire site or detect the strings where an individual cell
might require a closer look. The hotspots are detected using thermal and RGB cameras, which
are post-processed using computer vision. This data can be provided to technicians for repairing
panels.


The file motion contains the test script to test AStar algo for a no obstacle solar farm. It can be modilfied to work wih obstacles.
